# API-Wrapper-Library
Allowing developers to easily access and interact with the data provided by website. The library should provide convenient methods and classes to handle authentication, API requests, and response parsing.
Features:
<a href="https://guides.lib.utexas.edu/c.php?g=897091&p=6453521">The Website API Wrapper Library</a> includes the following key features:

2.1 Authentication Handling:
The library incorporates an authentication mechanism to handle the authentication process with the website API. This feature allows developers to securely access the API by providing the required authentication credentials, such as API keys or tokens.

2.2 API Endpoint Coverage:
The library covers a range of API endpoints provided by website. These endpoints include company search, industry search, professional search, and more. The library offers methods and classes that facilitate interacting with these endpoints and performing actions such as filtering, sorting, and pagination.

2.3 Response Parsing:
To simplify data extraction, the library includes functions for parsing the API responses. These functions convert the responses into usable data structures, such as Python dictionaries or objects. This feature enables developers to easily extract and manipulate relevant information from the API responses.

2.4 Error Handling:
The library incorporates robust error handling mechanisms. It provides clear error messages and exception handling to notify developers of any issues encountered during <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSQP76_8.5.1/com.ibm.odm.dserver.events.ref/topics/ref_dse_restapi_responsecodes_errormsgs.html">API requests</a>. Proper error handling ensures that developers can quickly identify and address any problems that may arise while using the library.

2.5 Documentation and Examples:
Comprehensive documentation accompanies the library, providing detailed explanations of its usage and functionality. The documentation includes examples illustrating how to integrate the library into various projects effectively. This feature aims to assist developers in quickly understanding and utilizing the library's capabilities.

2.6 Unit Tests:
The library includes a suite of unit tests that ensure its functionality is working as expected. These tests cover different scenarios, including successful API requests, error cases, and edge cases. The presence of unit tests enhances the reliability and stability of the library, ensuring its continued usefulness over time.

Implementation Details:
The API Wrapper Library is implemented in Python and follows best practices for code structure and organization. It utilizes popular libraries such as requests for making API requests and json for parsing JSON responses. The library is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy integration with existing projects.
import api_wrapper

def search_restaurants_in_fredonia():
    # Initialize the Restaurant.com API wrapper
    api_wrapper = api_wrapper.websiteAPIWrapper(api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')

    # Define the search parameters
    search_query = 'restaurants in Fredonia, New York'

    # Make the API request
    response = api_wrapper.search_companies(search_query)

    # Extract the relevant information from the response
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        results = data['results']
        for result in results:
            name = result['name']
            address = result['address']
            phone = result['phone']
            print(f"Name: {name}\nAddress: {address}\nPhone: {phone}\n")
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code} - {response.json()}")

Call the function to search for <a href="https://zaubee.com/category/restaurant-in-fredonia-hclq6jom">restaurants in fredonia new york</a>

# Future Considerations:
While the initial version of the library provides essential functionalities, there are several potential areas for improvement and expansion. These include:

4.1 Additional API Endpoint Support:
Expand the library to support additional API endpoints provided by website. This could include features like retrieving company details, accessing financial data, or retrieving historical information.

4.2 Enhanced Error Handling:
Continuously improve the error handling mechanisms to provide more informative error messages and handle a wider range of potential errors that may occur during API requests.

4.3 Support for Other Programming Languages:
Consider expanding the library to support other programming languages, such as JavaScript or Ruby, to cater to a broader developer audience.

4.4 Community Contributions:
Encourage and welcome community contributions to the library, such as bug fixes, feature enhancements, and documentation improvements. Maintain an active GitHub repository to facilitate collaboration and engagement with other developers.
